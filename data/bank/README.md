# Bank

**Description**:  

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model. | Integer | - |

| ***pdays*** | Feature | number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; -1 means client was not previously contacted) | Integer | - |
