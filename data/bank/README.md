## Variables

| Variable Name | Role | Description | Data Type | Range / Values |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ***age*** | Feature | Age of the individual | Integer | - |
| ***job*** | Feature | Job of the individual | Categorical | admin, blue-collar, entrepreneur, housemaid, management, retired, self-employed, services, student, technician, unemployed, unknown |
| ***marital*** | Feature | Marital status | Categorical | divorced, married, single, unknown |
| ***education*** | Feature | Education level | Categorical | basic.4y , basic.6y , basic.9y , high.school , illiterate , professional.course , university.degree , unknown	|
| ***default*** | Feature | Has credit in default? | Categorical | yes, no |
| ***balance*** | Feature | Average yearly balance | Integer | - |
| ***housing*** | Feature | Has housing loan? | Categorical | yes, no |
| ***loan*** | Feature | Has personal loan? | Categorical | yes, no |
| ***contact*** | Feature | Contact communication type | Categorical | cellular, telephone |

| ***month*** | Feature | Last contact month of year | Categorical | jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec |
| ***duration*** | Feature | Last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then target='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model. | Integer | - |
| ***campaign*** | Feature | Number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)	| Integer | - |
| ***pdays*** | Feature | number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; -1 means client was not previously contacted) | Integer | - |
| ***previous*** | Feature | Number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client | Integer | - |
| ***poutcome*** | Feature | Outcome of the previous marketing campaign | Categorical | failure, nonexistent, success | - |
| ***y*** | **Target** | Has the client subscribed a term deposit? | Categorical | yes, no |
